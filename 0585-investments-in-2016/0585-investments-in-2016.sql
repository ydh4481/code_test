-- Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

-- have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
-- are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
-- Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

-- The result format is in the following example.


SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
